TODO Several hundred words across multiple paragraphs
This is going to be a small-scale 2D game
Had to research Love2D programming and learn concepts
Trying to make a 2d game where a player traverses terrain. Have to learn how to do that. 
Read Sheepolution's "How to LOVE" at sheepolution.com
Initially wanted to make a water-like object, but that is too difficult to animate within this timeframe. Still, object should increase in size when it eats some powerups but loses size when taking damage from monsters
Use dynamic enemies that move from left to right of window, like a heated vent or lava pipe that moves
16th chapter into Sheepolution's guide and things are getting really math heavy. Making an object follow the mouse involves using vectors, radians, sine and cosine.
Object collision is very complex, though there are some pre-made libraries I can use, now that at least I understand the fundamentals of how it works.
Watched CS50's Colton's seminar to gain some more understanding into Lua and Love2d
At least ipairs is starting to feel normal.
Obtained some free tileset images from itch.io


Use BFXR for sound later on ?
