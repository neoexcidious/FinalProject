TODO Several hundred words across multiple paragraphs
This is going to be a small-scale 2D game
Had to research Love2D programming and learn concepts
Trying to make a game where the player is a water shaped object traverses terrain. Have to learn how to do that. 
Read Sheepolution's "How to LOVE" at sheepolution.com
Water object should increase in size when it reaches more water but loses size when going over hot surfaces or if trap doors close down on it.
Use dynamic enemies that move from left to right of window, like a heated vent or lava pipe that moves
16th chapter into Sheepolution's guide and things are getting really math heavy. Making an object follow the mouse involves using vectors, radians, sine and cosine.
Object collision is very complex, though there are some pre-made libraries I can use, now that at least I understand the fundamentals of how it works.
Back to game dynamic ideas, cold vent or icy surface that allows us to shoot icicles.
At least ipairs is starting to feel normal.
Have to get water shaped spritesheet from FreePik.com and code the sprite animation

Use BFXR for sound later on ?
