#### Description: 2D Platformer where you have to avoid death and collect the star

### Intro
I watched several of the provided seminars, but the one that stuck with me was "Making Small-Scale 2D Games with LÃ–VE 2D and Lua". Although I was not particularly interested in game development, I took what David Malan had said at some point in the course to heart, in that the goal of CS50 was to teach us how to teach ourselves new languages and create new things.
Thus, I decided to learn Lua and Love2D and create a small-scale 2D game. To achieve this, I had to research Love2D programming and learn some basic concepts. I found Sheepolution's guide (Read Sheepolution's "How to LOVE" at sheepolution.com) to be the easiest to understand, although Colton Ogden's CS50 Falling in Love with Lua was also helpful at times. Even so, in the 16th chapter of Sheepolution's guide, things were getting really math heavy. Making an object follow the mouse involves using vectors, radians, sine and cosine.
Object collision is also very complex, though there are some pre-made libraries I could use, now that I at least understood the fundamentals of how collision checks work. Given that I spent a whole week learning this new language, I gave myself a couple of more weeks to complete the actual project. I wanted to make a level the size of a Super Mario Bros level, but ultimately I decided that spending 3 weeks programming it + the initial first week of learning the basics was enough. Still, the level could easily be expanded now that the main functionality is in place.


### Classic.lua, Entity.Lua and the beginnings of Main.lua
After spending a week going through Sheepolution's guide and others, I was ready to try and make the game. I started by generating a map and trying to make the player traverse the terrain. This took some time but it was not that ultimately that difficult and I did this in main.lua. Following Sheepolution's guide, I imported the classic.lua open-source library and created myself an Entity.lua base class, from which I could extend other objects to create the player and the other elements in the game. I put the main collision check functions in Entity.lua so they can be easily extended to other objects.

### walls.lua
I obtained some free tileset images from itch.io in order to make the map tiles. These overlapped each other at first but I was able to fix that later on by resizing the wall.jpg file. Per Sheepolution's instructions, I made sure these are put in a different table in main, so they don't constantly check if they're colliding with other wall tiles.

### Player.lua
I created this file in order to write most of the code affecting the player therein. I initially wanted the player to be a water-shaped object, but after some research and remembering having seen videos about how hard it is for professional game devs to animate water, I realized that it would be too difficult to attempt it within my timeframe of a few weeks. Unfortunately, it took me precious days of trying different things, before I came to that conclusion and decided to simplify things.

### Food.lua
I wanted the object to increase its size when it ate food (powerups) and go down size when taking damage from enemies. This is when I created the food file. Unfortunately, the size increase appeared to make the game uglier and also cause some traversal issues, so I decided to change it to an increase in health, so if a player was hit by an enemy once but had collected food, the game would not be over right away.
Adding functionality to eat food was harder to implement than expected; again, collission checks.


### fireEnemy.lua and Fire.lua
I decided to use at least one dynamic enemy that moves from left to right, like a heated vent or lava pipe that moves and pours down fire. Initially called my file Enemy.lua, before I decided to add another type of enemy later on. 
I wanted to make the enemy move back and forth, have to do something similar to Sheepolution's chapter 14, but within certain fixed coordinates, rather than the window width. 
Had to figure out a while loop to make the enemy spit out fire constantly while the player is in close proximity - since I decided I did not just want it to be active at all times. Figured this might help game performance, but also seemed like a neat trick. To do all of this, I decided to separate this enemy into 2 files: one for the vent itself and one for the fire "bullets" that it spat out. I changed the texture of the fire later on, while struggling with an animation issue.

### More on Entity.lua
In order to make the fire disappear once it hit the wall underneath, I had to check for collision. This is where the code I initially had in Entity.lua came into play, but I realized that the latter was not sufficient to properly resolve the collision in this scenario. The constant fire was being generated using a table, so I could not simply add it to the list of objects that I was checking collision on constantly. Instead, I had to manually resolve the collision for each of the fire drops and kill them on contact.
Furthermore, I had to check their collision against the player and damage the latter on contact. I postponed deciding on what that would entail. 
Making the enemy collidable threw some errors, which I had to debug; turned out to be only a typo. I realized that Lua is not always very clear in its error descriptions, unlike Python and maybe even C (though that may have been because of certain CS50 features that came with our course). I also learned that Love2D does not have safeguards against infinite loops and will crash your game without telling you what went wrong - unlike the C and Python programs we've ran in the course. Though, again, those might have been hard coded into the CS50 library.

### camera.lua
After doing some research, I decided to import Stalker-X's free-use camera library for Love2d, as this -same as classic.lua, would be akin to importing a library in C or Python and would allow me to focus on building the actual game. I considered switching back to translate for camera, but later decided to keep this for the camera fade feature. Later on, I discerned that being able to set deadzones would allow me to keep the camera from moving past the boundaries of the screen. This however cost me several hours though, which trying to figure out a way to not have the deadzone make the camera move too far behind the player. Eventually, I decided to use an if statement to switch from one type of camera to another, depending on the player's x position. The transition  is still not 100% to my liking, as it jolts, but I could not waste anymore time perfecting it.

### More on main.lua and player.lua; Lume.lua
I added a gameOver flag and implemented some death conditions. Then, I added a health counter on screen and started implementing some key mapping at the top of the screen. 
I had to figure out how to load quads outside of main. This took me several days in total and made me question if Lua is really that popular. There is documentation for it out there, but Stack Overflow has very limited answers on this language. For example, everyone teaches how to draw quads from a spritesheet in main, but no one explains how to make the game draw quads properly while having your code in a different file (player.lua) and ensuring collision checks still work. At some point, I had to move on from the animation, to keep the project going. 
I added food collection to increase health, the actual health counter display, and the save and restart functions. To do the latter, I used the lume open-source library, recommended by Sheepolution and inserted this into lume.lua. I also finalized a pause game feature I had initiated earlier, added camera shakes when player takes damage, finalized a camera fade feature for when the game is over, added the game winning condition and flag and fixed some issues with timing between pause and gameOver events. While working on sounds, I also had to figure out how to stop music and sounds from playing more than once or having artefacts. Learned that I had to have these happen in love.update() for things to work properly. Finally, I added some more key mappings to the top of the screen, so the player knows how to move, save, load, restart and pause.

### iceEnemy
While I was moving on from the animation nightmare and changing the texture of the fireEnemy, I added a second enemy, this time in the form of tiles but with ice textures.
The concept was roughly the same with this one, except this one was static; I also had to create it twice in main, since each tile counted as one enemy, and I wanted 2 ice tiles.
While working on this, I learned that delta time can cause issues when moving a window due to the way love.run() works. In my case, the player would fall through the map when the window was moved. Turns out there's a simple fix by hard-capping the delta time at the top of love.update in main.

### More on player.lua animation
I finally managed to make the animation work. The solution I found was not obvious at all, and I'm sure there is a much better one out there. I essentially had to draw a black background frame, on which Lua finally let me draw my quads to generate the animation. I then added offset for direction control. At this point, I finally settled on a texture for the player (as I had gone through a few by now). With this done, I just had to fix a graphical artifact on certain collisions. I ended up fixing this by learning how to use the transparent canvas and eraser option in MS Paint 3D. I believe it was on the seminar that I heard that trying to perfect the artwork can take too much valuable time, so I should focus on the code itself primarily. This is why I left fixing some of these things until the end.

### sounds folder
I used BFXR to make some sound effects, and got a free music track from itch.io.
Learned how to stop updates when game is paused or over. Had to move the sound to love.update from love.draw to keep it from trying to play.

### sprites folder
This is where I eventually moved all the images for everything in the game. Most images were retrieved and edited from sites offering free sprites, like Pixabay or itch.io. I made sure to credit them as such.

### Star.lua
I wanted the player to have a final goal at the end of the map, so I created star.lua. I reused the code from food.lua to create this and added a sound to it.

### Final notes
Though I initially wanted this game to be bigger, the size of a Mario level, given that it took me a week just to learn the Lua and Love2D fundamentals and get familiar with it, plus the amount of time I spent
